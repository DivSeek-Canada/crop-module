# Data Subdirectory

This directory is empty (except for a **.gitignore** file) in the repository but should be populated with crop specific
data, including trait dictionaries, genomic and mapping data, or directives on where to get such data.

As the DivSeek Canada Portal project evolves, this README file will document what is needed in terms of site-specific
configuration and (meta-)data for loading, to support the user interface and scientific workflows on the site, 
for the given crop.
