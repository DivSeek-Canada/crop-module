# DivSeek Canada Portal

The [DivSeek Canada](http://www.divseekcanada.ca)  **Portal** is a web-based platform to implement association genetics workflows supporting plant breeding and crop research focusing on large scale plant genetic resources / crop genotype-phenotype data sets whose access is brokered / managed by the project.

# Genome Canada Pilot Project

The first iteration of the plaform is funded under a [Genome Canada Project](https://www.genomecanada.ca/en/divseek-canada-harnessing-genomics-accelerate-crop-improvement-canada) with co-funding from other partners.

# Initial Design

The platform is based on a customized deployment of the [Tripal](https://tripal.info/) web application, interacting with other open source bioinformatics tools such as the [Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org/).  The project is hosted on [Compute Canada](https://www.computecanada.ca/) cloud and high performance computing infrastructure. 

# Documentation

Some technical notes about the portal system will be compiled on the [Divseek Portal Wiki](https://github.com/DivSeek-Canada/divseek-canada-portal/wiki).
